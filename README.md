# Instana PHP SDK stubs

This repo provide stubs for the [Instana PHP SDK][docs]. You can use the stubs for adding autocompletion to your IDE. In addition, the stubs serve as a no-op fallback in case the Instana PHP SDK is unavailable in your code. The stubs provide no other functionality. The actual Instana PHP SDK is bundled with the Instana PHP Tracing extension.
